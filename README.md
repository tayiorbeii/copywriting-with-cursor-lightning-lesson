# Copywriting with Cursor

This is an example repo for my Copywriting with Cursor lightning lesson.

See [copywriting.dev](https://copywriting.dev) for more!

## How to use this repo

There are four branches that correspond to the four phases of the demonstration in the lesson:

1. `main`: Nothing going on here.
2. `phase-0-naive-prompt`: An initial prompt that doesn't get us very far.
3. `phase-1-aida-prompt`: A prompt that namedrops the AIDA framework.
4. `phase-2-context`: Adding context to the prompt.
5. `phase-3-rules-creation`: Incorporate Cursor rules to Agent prompts.
6. `phase-4-outline-workflow`: Branch for a live demo.
