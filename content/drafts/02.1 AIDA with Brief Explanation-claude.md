Subject: Your Website Is Losing Money While You Read This Email

Is your website turning visitors into customers... or just turning them away?

When potential clients visit your site but don't convert, that's real money walking out the door. Every day. Your competitors are capturing those customers while your powerful message remains unheard.

I help businesses like yours transform underperforming websites into conversion machines through strategic copywriting. My clients typically see:
- 35% increase in conversion rates within 60 days
- Significantly higher engagement metrics
- Clearer positioning against competitors

But don't just take my word for it. [Client Name] saw their inquiry rate double after we refreshed their homepage copy last month.

Ready to stop losing customers to poor messaging? I have three spots available for June projects.
